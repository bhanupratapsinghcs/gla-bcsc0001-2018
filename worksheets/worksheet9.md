# Worksheet 9

1. Write a function in C called **zero_small()** that has two integer arguments being passed by reference and sets the smaller of the two number to 0. Write the main program to access this function.

2. Write a program in C to determine all Pythagorean triplets in the range 100 to 1000.

   A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three integers *i*, *j* and *k* such that

3.  Write a program in C to read a line of text from the keyboard and display the following information on the screen

   1. the total number of words in the line
   2. the total number of characters in the line

4.  From a two-dimensional array `a[4][4]`, write a program in C to prepare a one-dimensional array `b[16]` that will have all the elements of `a[][]`. For example, for the following array

   1   2   3   4  
   5   6   7   8  
   9  10  11  12  
   13 14  15  16  

   The resultant array should be -

5.  Write a program in C that uses various functions to sum following series:

   1. ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$(1)+(1+2)+(1+2+3)+(1+2+3+4)+...\,upto\,N\,terms$$)
   2. ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$(2^2)+(2^2+4^2)+(2^2+4^2+6^2)+(2^2+4^2+6^2+8^2)+...\,upto\,N\,terms$$)
   3. ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$1+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{7}+\frac{1}{9}+\,...\,upto\,N\,terms$$)
   4. ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$1+\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{x^2}+\frac{1}{x^3}+\frac{1}{x^4}+\,...\,upto\,N\,terms$$)

6.   An array stores details of 25 students (rollno, name, marks in three subjects). Write a program in C to create such an array and print out a list of students who have failed in more than one subjects. Assume 40% as passing marks.
